    "\n",
    "In the nerfstudio DNeRF parser, `camera_angle_x` parameter (found in the transforms files) has a $1/tanh(0.5*x)$ relationship with the focal length. While I did mess around with this in [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xw0lodoghb) and initially selected a high $x=4.$ value. It didn't play well with kplanes (tested with scene contraction and varying near and far plane positions). In the end $x=0.6$ worked best despite how counter intuitive this is... The parameter is important for good rendering but is not directly recoverable from the nerfstudio dataset (it might be I just haven't looked into it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise the `rotation` parameter found for each frame doesn't seem to have any impact on performance (at least in the tests I ran with K-Planes, **this maybe different for other models!!!**)."

    "3. `downscale_images_fp` is the folder name inside of you nerfstudio folder containing the downscaled images if you would rather save these than the original images. As dnerf format doesn't consider downscaled images, this will allow you to use them instead.\n",

    "    - `'exhaustive'`    : match image to frame (**super slow**)\n",
    "    - `'linear'`    : assign time given image name-index (**fast**) (e.g. image w/name `frame_{i}.png` is going to be at i/n time where n is the number of images and `i` is the index; this is the image-naming format used by nerfstudio-colamp process)"
